# Simple Ecommerce App

This is a basic Ecommerce App based on React JS, Tailwind CSS, React-Scroll and Animation On Scroll (AOS).

I made this website without taking help from any resources, just downloaded the assets folder.The main reason for making this project is to practice responsive web design.

# Acquisition of knowledge

Below are the several new things that I have learned while making this project.

➡bg-gradient-to-r, It makes background from left to right we have to provide to more Tailwind properties for this (from-indigo-500 to-pink-500)
➡Object-postion:It is used to position a div inside a div or element inside element ,espacially if we want to display the particular part of the image.
➡If we want to provide custom value to tailwind breakpoints for just one or more , then it is good to provide value to the others too.
 screens: {
      xs: "256px",
      ss: "384px",
      sm: "640px",
      md: "768px",
      lg: "1024px",
      xl: "1280px",
    },
