# Simple Ecommerce App

This is a basic Ecommerce App based on React JS, Tailwind CSS, React-Scroll and Animation On Scroll (AOS).

I made this website without taking help from any resources, just downloaded the assets folder.The main reason for making this project is to practice responsive web design.
